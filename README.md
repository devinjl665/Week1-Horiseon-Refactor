## Week1-Horiseon-Refactor
Week 1 Challenge: On-the-job ticket for Horiseon. Refactoring codebase to make site more accessible. 
Tasks completed include: Consolidating and reorganizing the CSS stylesheet, adding alt text to images, commenting out stylesheet and html code, and making code easier to read.

Making a website more accessible allows it to be prioritized in the search engine. The easier it is to be seen, the less you have to spend on advertisements. Increasing revenue and lowering costs.

# User Story
As a marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

# Acceptance Criteria

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
