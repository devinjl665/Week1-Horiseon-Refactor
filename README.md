# Week1-Horiseon-Refactor

## Description

Week 1 Challenge: On-the-job ticket for Horiseon. Refactoring codebase to make site more accessible. 
Tasks completed include: Consolidating and reorganizing the CSS stylesheet, adding alt text to images, commenting out stylesheet and html code, and making code easier to read.

Making a website more accessible makes it more appealing to the consumer. The more people visit your site, the more it be will prioritized in the search engine. The easier it is to be seen, the less you have to spend on advertisements. Increasing revenue and lowering costs.

In the navigation bar there are three buttons labeled: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Marketing.

Alongside the info cards is some supplemental information about the benefits of search engine optimization.
